# Web Application Security
***

### Overview
Web application security is all about securing applications operating on Layer 7 on the OSI model. 

There are two different approaches that can be taken to security testing for Layer 7 web applications: 
- White box testing (i.e. full access to the source code, using SAST tools to scan) = what we know as "Application Security";
- Black box testing (no access to the source code, use of DAST tools to scan for vulnerabilities) = what we know as "Penetration Testing".

Two sides of the same coin!
